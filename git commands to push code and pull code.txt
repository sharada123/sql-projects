In the command prompt after installation, set the username and user-email. This is done only once after installation.

git config --global user.name "ekwinder"

git config --global user.email "ekwinder@itvedant.com"

------------------------------
For every new project you will initiatize a new repository, but do this once for that project

git init

-----------------------------
Everytime you are going to make any change in your project, first add the files in the staging area

To add all the files/folders in work directory
init add .

To add specific file
init add sample.txt demo.txt

-------------------------
After adding the files in the staging, you can review them and then decide whether you want to commit them in the repo or not

Next you will commit the files in the repo. While committing we will also specify a message to indicate what the commit is about

git commit -m 'some message'

----------------------------

To sync the local and remote repository, first we will register remote repo and change the branch to main. Do this step once.

git remote add origin https://github.com/ekwinderbhurji/sales-sql-project.git

git branch -M main

-----------------------------
Now to actually sync both the repos. Run this for final update in the remote repo

git push -u origin mainâ€‹
